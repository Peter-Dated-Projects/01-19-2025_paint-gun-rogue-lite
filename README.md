# 01-19-2025 - Paint Gun Rogue-Lite

Welcome to game devevelopment with Peter! Today we will be coding the greatest game to ever walk the earth. Walk. No.. more like `ink` the earth haha... yeah its an ink game. **Splatoon** but better and rogue-lite and with **teleportation** because that's always nice.

Also...

We've got anime based lore lol. That's good right? Kinda like `Wistoria` but **ink** and **squids** and *gun** and **teleport**.
